# VisSE

The [VisSE project](https://www.ucm.es/visse) aims to develop tools that ease
the use and understanding of [SignWriting](https://signwriting.org/) in the
digital world. SignWriting is a system for visually transcribing sign languages
into a 2D page, i.e. a writing system for sign languages.

This repository collects the different software results of the project, and
instructions for their use.

## Production

Use the `setup.sh` script to deploy the project.

## Development

This repository is also a [meta](https://github.com/mateodelnorte/meta)
repository. Clone it with `meta git clone` or use `meta git update`.

## Acknowledgements

reference number PR2014_19/01, was developed in the Faculty of Computer Science
